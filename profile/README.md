## About us
Blackout Innovations is a technology company based in France, specializing in two areas: first, developing games for clients or internal use, and second, creating affordable and lightweight night vision goggles. On the game development side, we are currently working on publishing our first in-house developed game, SCP: Blackout. The game features both single-player and multiplayer RPG modes, and we aim to create what many are calling the "perfect SCP game." Follow the game's development on our online channels.
